NN-DeleteRomance
================

<b>Tame your eBook releases and delete books based on specific criteria.

<b>Purpose:</b>

I was sick and tired of looking at all the ebook releases and seeing a great deal of books delaing with Romance, Erotica, and Fetish style subjects. In addition, with the ease and proliferation of self-publishing authors, I found also a great deal of these books that lack "quality" as they have not been vetted by major publishing houses. This is not to detract from the merit of self-published authors. But since life is short, and there is a great abundance of quality books, I decided to weed these out as well.

<b>How the Script Works:</b>

It is pretty straight forward. I have for close to 2 months been building lists of keywords that I find are common to these books. These lists are either know publishers of the objectionable content, known authors, keywords, and abbreviations that are telltale signs of a book to be deleted.

I have broken the script into the various categories above, and created text files that contain these lists.

The real strengnth of this script and its lists is that is is constantly evolving/expanding. New authors, publishers, keywords, etc. are added daily to the lists to capture books as they are released. Since the lists are read from  publicly shared files, there is no effeort required on the user's part. <b>I am doing all the work for you!</b>
