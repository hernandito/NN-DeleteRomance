NN-DeleteRomance
================

<b>Tame your eBook releases and delete books based on specific criteria.

<b>Purpose:</b>

I was sick and tired of looking at all the ebook releases and seeing a great deal of books delaing with Romance, Erotica, and Fetish style subjects. In addition, with the ease and proliferation of self-publishing authors, I found also a great deal of these books that lack "quality" as they have not been vetted by major publishing houses. This is not to detract from the merit of self-published authors. But since life is short, and there is a great abundance of quality books, I decided to weed these out as well.

<b>How the Script Works:</b>

It is pretty straight forward. I have for close to 2 months been building lists of keywords that I find are common to these books. These lists are either know publishers of the objectionable content, known authors, keywords, and abbreviations that are telltale signs of a book to be deleted.

I have broken the script into the various categories above, and created text files that contain these lists.

The real strengnth of this script and its lists is that is is constantly evolving/expanding. New authors, publishers, keywords, etc. are added daily to the lists to capture books as they are released. Since the lists are read from  publicly shared files, there is no effort required on the user's part. <b>I am doing all the work for you!</b> 

The script also pulls one cool trick. It searches the ebook tables for books that <b>have</b> covers, but do <b>not have</b> a publisher listed. These are one sign of self-published books. Unfortunately, about 40% of self-published books get by. In order to catch those, I need some coding help. I outline the issue [here](http://www.newznabforums.com/index.php?topic=1085.msg9479#msg9479). Please read the whole post and if you can help, please post me a message of the forum.

<b>Instructions:</b>

<b>BACKUP YOUR DATABASE!!!! </b>You have been warned.

Copy deleteromance.php to your /misc/testing folder and execute.

If you want to run and maintain your own lists, copy all the .txt files to a folder accessible to your web site. Edit the path at the top of the php to point to the folder where these files are stored. Edit the .txt files to yor hearts content... but please note that it took me 2 months of adding words to these lists on a daily basis.

<b>Next Steps:</b>

This script is not remotely done... I need 2 crucial components to make it 98% reliable... As I explained earlier, because of my lack of codings skills, I need help coding some additional parts. I will create a post on the nn-forum dedicated to this script. I will ask for specific help there.

Last note: I am CLUELESS how to operate Github. I copied and pasted the test into the github site. So please do not ask me to branch, clone, stage, commit, pull, ejaculate or expectorate. I have a vague notion about how it works, but I don't have the patience to learn it. I did learn the ejaculate part though....
